1. Bug: food falling infinitely when double clicking z
	- precondition: picked up food
	- trigger: pressing z (picking up/putting down) twice fast
	- effect: food falls infinitely and through floor
	- notes:
		- /sometimes/ the food only falls a certain distance (nearly one screen's length), noticeable if penwing's at the top of the screen

2. Bug: floating penwing
	- precondition: penwing is grounded (i.e. on floor)
	- trigger: pressing left/right-arrow then down-arrow (slide) really fast
	- effect: penwing freezes in the pre-slide animation
	- notes:
		- penwing can still do actions
		- hit box remains in the vertical position (as if they are idle or running)
		- left/right movement, picking up/putting down food, and falling don't break them out of it
		- manually triggering another animation (space bar/jumping, reclicking down-arrow/slide) breaks them out of it
		- doesn't trigger when pressing the offending buttons in the reverse order

3. FIXED Issue: can't put down food while facing left
	- precondition: picked up food and facing left
	- effect: none and that's the problem TT

5. FIXED Issue: penwing's hit box not changed when jumping
	- effect: they can't jump over obstacles, only holes

4. FIXED Issue: penwing unlocked the ability to fly
	- trigger: holding down space bar (jumping)
	- effect: causes you to fly for as long as you hold it :D

5. FIXED Issue: penwing can become spider-man and stick to walls
	- trigger: holding left/right-arrow while beside the edge of a wall
	- effect: lets you defy gravity for as long as you want

6. Bug: putting down food makes the food become self-driving car
	- precondition: holding food, maybe more ?
	- trigger: idk i can't recreate TT it just happens sometimes and i can't figure out 	what the trigger is
	- effect: the food will fall when put down (intended), then after about one or two 	seconds, the food just starts moving away from penwing

7. Issue: penwing's animation/collider dips into floor when he is in pre-slide animation
	- trigger: sliding
	- effect: he falls into the floor before coming back up to normal
	- notes: the problem lies with his pre-slide animation and collider box

8. FIXED Issue: getting off the chandelier is broken when holding food
	- precondition: holding food and swinging (holding z down)
	- trigger: releasing z (stop swinging)
	- desired effect: penwing is propelled in the direction you are holding down
	- actual effect: penwing freezes mid-air, then falls when you release z and the arrow 	key

9. Bug: the jump animation is constantly triggered when penwing is holding food and swinging
	- precondition: holding food and swinging
	- desired effect: penwing is locked in swing animation
	- actual effect: penwing's jump animation is played on loop
	- notes: swinging still works fine, it's just an animation bug

10. FIXED Bug: flight unlocked
	- trigger: pressing jump (x) repeatedly
	- desired effect: penwing can only jump when he is on the ground
	- actual effect: he jumps from midair and gets higher and higher
	- note: only happens when he is on elevator

11. Bug: jumping on elevator leaves penwing stuck in jump animation
	- precondition: standing on elevator
	- trigger: jumping (x)
	- desired effect: normal jump
	- actual effect: penwing stops midair and just hangs there
	- note: moving off of the elevator resets/fixes it

12. Issue: penwing doesn't directly follow elevator when moving up and down
	- precondition: on elevator and moving
	- desired effect: penwing and elevator move simultaneously
	- actual effect:
		- when moving up, penwing dips slightly into the elevator for a second
		- when moving down, penwing takes a second before falling to where the 				elevator is
	- note: setting the player's parent to the elevator works to have the intended 			effect, but has the unintended effect of shrinking the player's scale to match the 		elevator, distorting penwing's size

13. Issue: penwing doesn't get the falling penalty when landing on the elevator
	- precondition: falling on to elevator
	- desired effect: blink and drop food
	- actual effect: none

14. FIXED Bug: penwing doesn't detect food/chandelier if you're not inputting a direction
	- precondition: standing beside food
	- desired effect: detecting food
	- actual effect: hitObject() returns null
