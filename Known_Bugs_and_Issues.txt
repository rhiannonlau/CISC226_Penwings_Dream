1. Bug: food falling infinitely when double clicking z
	- precondition: picked up food
	- trigger: pressing z (picking up/putting down) twice fast
	- effect: food falls infinitely and through floor
	- notes:
		- /sometimes/ the food only falls a certain distance (nearly one screen's length), noticeable if penwing's at the top of the screen

2. Bug: floating penwing
	- precondition: penwing is grounded (i.e. on floor)
	- trigger: pressing left/right-arrow then down-arrow (slide) really fast
	- effect: penwing freezes in the pre-slide animation
	- notes:
		- penwing can still do actions
		- hit box remains in the vertical position (as if they are idle or running)
		- left/right movement, picking up/putting down food, and falling don't break them out of it
		- manually triggering another animation (space bar/jumping, reclicking down-arrow/slide) breaks them out of it
		- doesn't trigger when pressing the offending buttons in the reverse order

3. FIXED Issue: can't put down food while facing left
	- precondition: picked up food and facing left
	- effect: none and that's the problem TT

5. FIXED Issue: penwing's hit box not changed when jumping
	- effect: they can't jump over obstacles, only holes

4. FIXED Issue: penwing unlocked the ability to fly
	- trigger: holding down space bar (jumping)
	- effect: causes you to fly for as long as you hold it :D

5. FIXED Issue: penwing can become spider-man and stick to walls
	- trigger: holding left/right-arrow while beside the edge of a wall
	- effect: lets you defy gravity for as long as you want

6. FIXED? Bug: putting down food makes the food become self-driving car
	- precondition: holding food, maybe more ?
	- trigger: idk i can't recreate TT it just happens sometimes and i can't figure out 	what the trigger is
	- effect: the food will fall when put down (intended), then after about one or two 	seconds, the food just starts moving away from penwing

7. Issue: penwing's animation/collider dips into floor when he is in pre-slide animation
	- trigger: sliding
	- effect: he falls into the floor before coming back up to normal
	- notes: the problem lies with his pre-slide animation and collider box

8. FIXED Issue: getting off the chandelier is broken when holding food
	- precondition: holding food and swinging (holding z down)
	- trigger: releasing z (stop swinging)
	- desired effect: penwing is propelled in the direction you are holding down
	- actual effect: penwing freezes mid-air, then falls when you release z and the arrow 	key

9. Bug: the jump animation is constantly triggered when penwing is holding food and swinging
	- precondition: holding food and swinging
	- desired effect: penwing is locked in swing animation
	- actual effect: penwing's jump animation is played on loop
	- notes: swinging still works fine, it's just an animation bug

10. FIXED Bug: flight unlocked
	- trigger: pressing jump (x) repeatedly
	- desired effect: penwing can only jump when he is on the ground
	- actual effect: he jumps from midair and gets higher and higher
	- note: only happens when he is on elevator
	- fix: changing GetKey to GetKeyDown

11. Bug: jumping on elevator leaves penwing stuck in jump animation
	- precondition: standing on elevator
	- trigger: jumping (x)
	- desired effect: normal jump
	- actual effect: penwing stops midair and just hangs there
	- note: moving off of the elevator resets/fixes it

12. Issue: penwing doesn't directly follow elevator when moving up and down
	- precondition: on elevator and moving
	- desired effect: penwing and elevator move simultaneously
	- actual effect:
		- when moving up, penwing dips slightly into the elevator for a second
		- when moving down, penwing takes a second before falling to where the 				elevator is
	- note: setting the player's parent to the elevator works to have the intended 			effect, but has the unintended effect of shrinking the player's scale to match the 		elevator, distorting penwing's size

13. FIXED Issue: penwing doesn't get the falling penalty when landing on the elevator
	- precondition: falling on to elevator
	- desired effect: blink and drop food
	- actual effect: none
	- fix: make currentFloor = 99 when standing on elevator

14. FIXED Bug: penwing doesn't detect food/chandelier if you're not inputting a direction
	- precondition: standing beside food
	- desired effect: detecting food
	- actual effect: hitObject() returns null

15. FIXED Bug: player gets pushed by food when holding food
	- precondition: holding food
	- desired effect: none
	- actual effect: food has invisible jetpacks that push the player
	- fix: turn simulated off on food's rigidbody

16. Issue: No floor under elevator
	- note: can't add the floor to the floor layer otherwise it will conflict with the elevator when the elevator is on the ground floor

16. FIXED Issue: food can't be passed through by player if they are trying to pick up one of the foods that's further
	- note: solution might be to make the food a child of the counter object
	- note: that was not the solution
	- fix: made isTrigger = true, and rb type = static to make it pass through able and not moving, respectively

18. Issue: elevator needs to come to the floor the player is on when they are standing on a certain section in case they've fallen
	- option 1: plan is to have a small overlapping piece of floor that serves as a 	sensor. if they're standing on this small area and the elevator is not on the floor 	they are on, move it.
	- option 2: maybe make it an interact? so like there's a small control 	panel, and 	when they interact with it, the elevator comes up to their floor
		- does this add an element of strategy? like if they know they'll need the 			elevator later and they're nearby, they can click it to save time then go do 		what they need to?

19: FIXED Bug: food flies off of table lol
	- precondition: placed order down on table
	- desired effect: it stays there
	- actual effect: red bull gives you wiiiiings
	- fix: within the check in Update() that checks if they are holding food (above if (hitObject()), used Invoke(nameof(DropFood), 0f); instead of DropFood(); this forces DropFood() to be activated later in the frame. 

20. FIXED Bug: double clicking on the table when taking the order
	- precondition: you've taken the table's order
	- trigger: pressing interact (z) with the table again when you don't have food in your hand
	- desired effect: none
	- actual effect: game crashes
	- fix: if check to ensure you are holding food and that the table has no food/child objects (if (holdingFood && table.transform.childCount == 0))

21. FIXED Issue: unable to pick up/put down food when standing on elevator
	- fix: added "or if on elevator" clause to pick up and put down
