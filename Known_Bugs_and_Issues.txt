1. Bug: food falling infinitely when double clicking w
	- precondition: picked up food
	- trigger: pressing w (picking up/putting down) twice fast
	- effect: food falls infinitely and through floor
	- notes:
		- /sometimes/ the food only falls a certain distance (nearly one screen's length), noticeable if penwing's at the top of the screen

2. Bug: floating penwing
	- precondition: penwing is grounded (i.e. on floor)
	- trigger: pressing left/right-arrow then down-arrow (slide) really fast
	- effect: penwing freezes in the pre-slide animation
	- notes:
		- penwing can still do actions
		- hit box remains in the vertical position (as if they are idle or running)
		- left/right movement, picking up/putting down food, and falling don't break them out of it
		- manually triggering another animation (space bar/jumping, reclicking down-arrow/slide) breaks them out of it
		- doesn't trigger when pressing the offending buttons in the reverse order

3. FIXED Issue: can't put down food while facing left
	- precondition: picked up food and facing left
	- effect: none and that's the problem TT

5. FIXED Issue: penwing's hit box not changed when jumping
	- effect: they can't jump over obstacles, only holes

4. FIXED Issue: penwing unlocked the ability to fly
	- trigger: holding down space bar (jumping)
	- effect: causes you to fly for as long as you hold it :D

5. Issue: penwing can become spider-man and stick to walls
	- trigger: holding left/right-arrow while beside the edge of a wall
	- effect: lets you defy gravity for as long as you want

6. Bug: putting down food makes the food become self-driving car
	- precondition: holding food, maybe more ?
	- trigger: idk i can't recreate TT it just happens sometimes and i can't figure out what the trigger is
	- effect: the food will fall when put down (intended), then after about one or two seconds, the food just starts moving away from penwing

7. Issue: penwing's animation/collider dips into floor when he in pre-slide animation
	- trigger: sliding
	- effect: he falls into the floor before coming back up to normal
	- notes: the problem lies with his pre-slide animation and collider box
